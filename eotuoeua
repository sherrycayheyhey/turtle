# if you're only using something a few times, import the whole module and write it out the long way
# so that you can see that it's the module that contains the class: import turtle...timmy = turtle.Turtle()

# if you're using something from a module 3 or more times, use "from turtle import Turtle" so you can write
# tommy = Turtle()

# don't use "from turtle import *" because it isn't expressive (when you read your code it won't be easy to tell
# where it came from) and the python community doesn't like it

# you can use an alias for long module names, like import pandas as pd

# some modules are packaged with the python standard library (like Turtle), but others aren't, so you'll have to
# install them before importing them, use pypi.org for this
